# LedgerFlow — Phases 3–8 Implementation Summary

## Delivered scope

### Phase 3 — Contacts, products, and services
- Tenant-scoped customer/vendor/dual-role contacts and product/service records with archive/restore-oriented workflows, account/tax assignments, contact payment terms, and opening balance fields. Contact balances correctly net credits/payments in company home currency and show separate A/R and A/P for dual-role contacts.
- Inventory quantity and average-cost tracking, opening inventory journals, and stock adjustments with balanced accounting and movement history.
- CSV import workflow for contacts, products, and Chart of Accounts with row-level error reporting and import batches.

### Phase 4 — Sales and purchasing
- Invoices, estimates, sales receipts, bills, expenses, purchase orders, credit memos, vendor credits, customer payments, and vendor payments.
- Issue/approve/convert/void workflows (including estimate-to-invoice and purchase-order-to-bill), tax-inclusive/exclusive calculations, payment allocations, partial balances, and inventory/COGS movements. Estimate-to-invoice and purchase-order-to-bill conversions are database-unique to prevent duplicates. Vendor-credit inventory returns reduce carrying value at average cost, with any purchase-price difference posted to COGS/variance.
- Balanced journal posting validated in application code and protected by deferred PostgreSQL constraints in the migration chain. Void now refuses paid/partially paid or converted documents, safely reverses inventory only when there have been no later stock movements, and restores bill average-cost snapshots; all voids are audited.

### Phase 5 — Banking
- Bank and credit-card account setup, CSV/OFX statement import (case-insensitive headers, currency-formatted amounts, debit/credit columns), duplicate detection including statements without external IDs, FX-aware suggested/manual matching, categorization/splitting, transfers, and reconciliation with prior-period balance roll-forward and cancellation of in-progress reconciliations.
- Matches post balanced journals or settle already-recorded expenses; customer/vendor settlements account for foreign-currency rate differences. Reconciliation creation/edit/completion and stock-affecting postings use transaction isolation/locking to guard against conflicting concurrent operations.

### Phase 6 — Reporting and tax
- Accrual and cash-basis Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Trial Balance, General Ledger, transaction detail, A/R and A/P aging, sales/customer/product analysis, vendor expenses, sales tax liability, purchase tax credit, realized FX, and unrealized FX revaluation reports.
- JSON, CSV, XLSX, and PDF report output, saved report configurations, tax-rate management, and closed-period controls synchronized against concurrent journal posting.
- Purchase taxes can post to asset accounts; sales tax uses liability accounts. Home-currency changes are locked after financial setup/activity to protect historical reporting.

### Phase 7 — Dashboard and document delivery
- Dashboard cash, receivables/payables, recent performance, expense categories, and follow-up items.
- Invoice/bill PDF generation, invoice email via configured SMTP, global search across contacts/products/invoices/bills, working New Invoice and sign-out actions, responsive mobile navigation, and interface polish.

### Phase 8 — Stripe
- Checkout payment links for open invoices, idempotent session reuse, signed raw-body webhook verification, payment recording, and automatic journal/receivable settlement.
- Live Stripe secret/webhook keys and a public return URL must be configured before use.

## Verification performed

- Backend: `npx prisma generate`, `npx prisma validate`, `npm run build`, and `RUN_DB_INTEGRATION=true npm test -- --runInBand` succeeded. All 7 suites and 29 tests passed with no skips, including the PostgreSQL-backed API and deferred journal-balance constraint tests.
- Database: PostgreSQL 17 was started for this workspace; all six migrations applied successfully, the demo seed completed, and `prisma migrate status` reports the database up to date. Demo login and dashboard/accounts/contacts/products APIs were exercised through the Vite proxy.
- Frontend: `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` succeeded after current UI changes.
- Migration consistency: prior migration SQL was structurally compared against Prisma-generated SQL; the conversion-uniqueness index was checked against Prisma-generated DDL. All migrations have now also been applied to PostgreSQL in this workspace.

## Not verified / operational requirements

- The local PostgreSQL migration, seed, API integration, and deferred journal-balance constraint tests passed. External deployment environments still need their own database migration and seed.
- SMTP delivery and Stripe Checkout/webhook behavior require provider credentials and a reachable webhook; they were not tested live.
- The current package installation reported security advisories: backend 8 (including 2 critical) and frontend 10 (including 1 high). Dependencies should be reviewed and patched before production deployment.
- Demo login `owner@demo.com` / `Admin@12345` was seeded and verified against the running local app. Change this development password before deploying outside this sandbox.
